# X-ray-Dignostics-using-ML for detecting P


This project aims to use machine learning to assist doctors and radiologists in diagnosing medical conditions from X-ray images in detecting Pneumonia.

Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Numpy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
TensorFlow
Keras
Matplotlib


Dataset
We used the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle, which contains 5,863 X-ray images of healthy and pneumonia-infected lungs.

You can download the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

for execution you can the python file and do the implementation

And by opening the application file you can fine the frontend related implementation. 


Results
We achieved an accuracy of 99% on the test set using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The model can classify X-ray images as either healthy or infected with pneumonia.

we have also achived test accuracy of 71%

Conclusion
Machine learning can be a valuable tool for diagnosing medical conditions from X-ray images. Our model achieved high accuracy and can be used to assist doctors and radiologists in making diagnoses. However, further research and validation are needed before deploying the model in clinical settings.
